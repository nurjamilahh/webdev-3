* **Modern CSS Layouts:** Utilized **Flexbox** for constructing flexible and efficient section arrangements.
* **Semantic HTML Structure:** Employed correct HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.) for improved accessibility and search engine optimization.
* **Visual Portfolio Cards:** Styled cards or sections to neatly present past professional achievements.
* **Consistent Styling:** Application of a defined color palette and typography rules throughout the site for a professional look.
