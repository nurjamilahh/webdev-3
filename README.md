## Project Structure

This section is included primarily as a memory aid for me to internalize common project organization conventions in software engineering, as I am a career switcher.

This project uses a standard, logical file organization commonly found in web applications:

```text
/milestone-1-nurjamilahh/
├── index.html                      <-- Main landing page
├── /assets/
│   ├── /images/
│   │   ├── nur-profile-large.webp  <-- Responsive image in WebP format
│   │   ├── nur-profile-medium.webp
│   │   ├── nur-profile-small.webp
│   │   └── ...other project images
│   └── /fonts/
├── /css/
│   ├── main.css                    <-- Core layout and component styles
│   ├── header-nav.css
│   ├── about.css  
│   ├── contact.css         
│   └── footer.css
└── /pages/
    ├── about.html
    └── contact.html

```

## Features Implemented

The implementation of this module focuses heavily on robust structure and modern styling principles:

* **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive, ensuring optimal viewing across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile) using **Media Queries**.
* **Modern CSS Layouts:** Utilized **Flexbox** for constructing flexible and efficient section arrangements.
* **Semantic HTML Structure:** Employed correct HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.) for improved accessibility and search engine optimization.
* **Visual Portfolio Cards:** Styled cards or sections to neatly present past professional achievements.
* **Consistent Styling:** Application of a defined color palette and typography rules throughout the site for a professional look.

## 🖼️ Demo & Screenshots of Responsive Web Pages 

### 1. Mobile View ($< 768\text{px}$)
The layout is a single, vertical column for fast scrolling and maximum readability. Navigation is condensed into a **Hamburger Icon**.

### 2. Tablet View ($\ge 768\text{px}$)
The design expands to utilize the wider screen.
